<ul>
<li>Two types of allowed users are Admin and Student; both are classes inherited from class User(defined by username, password, first name, and last name)</li>
<li>Admin task: course management(create/delete/edit/display information of a given course; register a student) and reports(view all/only full courses; write into file full courses; view a course's registered students; view a student's registered courses; sort courses by registered student amount)</li>
<li>Student task: course management(view all/not full courses; course registering; course withdrawing; view registed courses)</li>
<li>Serialization and deserialization for storing and fetching objects</li>
<li>Storing and managing student information, records and registerd courses</li>

<li><a href="/project_2_algorithms/src/Recursion.java">Recursion</a>: binary recursive algorithm that finds the maximum number in array of size n; number of zeroes in the binary representation of N; checks if word is a palindrome</li>
<li><a href="./project_2_algorithms/src/Sort.java">Sorting</a>: bubble sort recursive/non-ecursive, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort </li>

<li><a href="./project_3_linkedlist">Serving Customers in Queues</a>
<ul>
<li>Given a group of <a href="./project_3_linkedlist/src/Customer.java">customers</a> along with an arrival time for each customer, generate cutomer queuing dynamics with <a href="./project_3_linkedlist/src/LinkedListQueue.java">Linked-List</a></li>
<li>Being able to find a customer's estimated waiting time, maximum customers to be served on a given day, (longest) idle time of an emplyee, longest  length of existing queues within <a href="./project_3_linkedlist/src/Service.java">service simulation</a></li>
